# SPROUT - Alga-E Team

> Fight. Grow. Heal the world with the power of nature.

Introducing the first iOS game designed and developed by the **Alga-E** team at Apple Developer Academy 22/23.

---

"Sprout" is a pixel-art-styled arcade game, revolving around the last little plant remaining on a dying Earth.

The main goal of the game is defeating the robotic bugs to protect the sprout by swiping on them and preserve the sprout three leaves/lives.
