First game project by Alga-E developer team at ADA 22/23.

"Sprout" is a leaderboard-based arcade game, revolving around the last little plant remaining on a dying Earth.
The main goal of the game is protecting the sproute and helping it to survive until the very end by defeating its enemies during the attack attempts.
An easy and intuitive interface will support the user who just needs to swipe on the enemies to destroy them and preserve the sprout three leaves/lives, while seeing their score raising - it's good to have a bit more motivation, isn't it?
On a further note, the 32 bit pixel art style will throw the user back in time to save the world while having fun in a dystopic-but-cool scenario.
