"Sprout" is a pixel-art-style mobile game revolving around a little plant, a sprout, being the last living creature on a dying Earth. 

As the sprout is the last and only hope of the planet, the player's mission is to protect it from the robotic bugs that threaten its existence.

Gameplay involves swiping on the screen to destroy the incoming robotic bugs, preventing them from taking away the plant's three lives.

The game is based on a scoring system, where players earn points for each robotic bug they destroy. The more bugs they destroy, the higher their score is, while the game progressively becomes more challenging with more and faster enemies.
