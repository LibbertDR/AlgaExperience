# Alga-E project repository 
First game project by Alga-E team at Apple Developer Academy 22/23.

"Sprout" is an iOS arcade game, revolving around the last little plant remaining on a dying Earth.

The main goal of the game is defeating the robotic bugs to protect the sprout by swiping on them and preserve the sprout three leaves/lives.

On a further note, the 32 bit pixel art style will throw the user back in time to save the world while having fun in a dystopic-but-cool scenario.
